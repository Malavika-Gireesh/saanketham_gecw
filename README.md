# Saanketham GEC Wayanad 📡⚙️

This is the official website for Saanketham, the Technical Club of Government Engineering College, Wayanad. Our goal is to provide a central platform for students to access information, resources, and opportunities to enhance their technical skills and knowledge.

## Our Approach: Built with Bare-Bones 💻

In a world full of frameworks, we took a principled stand. This website is built from the ground up using Vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. There are no frameworks, no external libraries, and no build tools. This was a deliberate choice for several key reasons:

- *Deep Learning*: By avoiding frameworks, we've gained a profound understanding of core web development concepts. We've mastered the Document Object Model (DOM), the Fetch API, and responsive design using pure CSS.

- *Performance*: The website is incredibly lightweight and fast. Without the overhead of a framework, we deliver a seamless user experience.

- *Ownership*: Every line of code is ours. We have complete control and a deep understanding of how our website works, which makes debugging and maintenance more direct.

## Key Features 🍀

- *Scholarship Finder*: A powerful, client-side tool for students to easily search, filter, and view globally and regionally available scholarships. All data is managed locally to keep the site fast and simple.

## The Automation: Our Custom Python Script 🤖

Managing scholarship data manually can be a pain. To solve this, we've developed a custom Python script that automates the update process.

- *How It Works*: This script fetches the latest scholarship information from a predefined source (e.g., a CSV file, a Google Sheet, or an API), processes the data, and automatically generates the scholarships.json file.

- *No Admin Panel Needed*: This automated workflow allows us to keep the website completely static. We simply run the script, and a new scholarships.json file is created. After that, we just push the updated file to our Git repository, and the website is automatically deployed with the new data.

This ingenious method allows us to have a dynamic, up-to-date website without the complexity, cost, or security vulnerabilities of a traditional backend system. It's a perfect example of solving a problem with a simple, effective, and self-made solution.
### Getting Started 🦾

To run this project locally, you only need to open view/index.html in your browser. To update the scholarship data, follow the instructions in the scripts/ directory to run the Python script.
- Follow the instructions to clone the repository.
```
git clone https://github.com/Malavika-Gireesh/saanketham_gecw.git
